Uno on console (I mean terminal console, not game console) 

Uno on console. Need anything else? Oh and by console I mean computer console, the command prompt on Windows or Terminal on Linux and MacOS, not... game console like PS4 and XB1 or the Switch (can I actually make it into a full program?)

Anyways, enjoy the game when it's done, which will probably take a while

Rated M:

- Explicit language

- Edgy jokes (that might be offensive)

- Copyrighted memes according to Article 13

- Everything above is exaggregated, it's not as bad as it seems, only have a couple jokes from Vanoss and the crew. Some from our lord Pewdiepie
